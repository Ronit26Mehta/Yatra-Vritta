# 🧠 AI-Powered Ranking Engine for Smart Travel Recommendations

## **📌 Overview**
Yatra-Vritta incorporates an **AI-driven ranking system** to provide intelligent recommendations for **Medical Tourism, MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions), and Destination Weddings**. This system employs **machine learning techniques, multi-criteria decision-making models, and real-time data analysis** to dynamically rank global destinations.

### **🔹 Key AI Techniques Used**
- **Weighted Score Computation** – Assigns importance to different ranking factors.
- **Min-Max Normalization** – Standardizes data across different metrics.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation** – Handles missing data using AI.
- **Regression-Based Predictions** – Predicts missing values when necessary.
- **AI-Based Trend Forecasting** – Predicts emerging travel destinations.

---

## **1️⃣ Medical Tourism AI Ranking Model**

### **📌 Data Collection**
Medical tourism data is sourced from:
- **World Bank API** – Healthcare expenditure, hospital availability, GDP.
- **OECD Economic Indicators** – Business environment and stability scores.
- **United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)** – International tourism data.

Each country is represented as a **feature matrix**:

```math
X \in R^{N \times M}
```
Where:
- \( N \) = Number of countries
- \( M \) = Number of key medical indicators

### **📌 Weighted Score Formula**
Each country receives a **Medical Tourism Score (S_i)** calculated as:

```math
S_i = w_1 H_i + w_2 E_i + w_3 G_i + w_4 T_i + w_5 B_i + w_6 S_i
```

Where:
- \( H_i \) = Hospital Beds per 1,000 people
- \( E_i \) = Healthcare Spending per Capita (USD)
- \( G_i \) = GDP per Capita (USD)
- \( T_i \) = Annual Tourist Arrivals (millions)
- \( B_i \) = Ease of Business Score
- \( S_i \) = Safety Index (Low Crime Rate)

**Assigned Weights:**
```math
w_1 = 0.3, w_2 = 0.25, w_3 = 0.2, w_4 = 0.1, w_5 = 0.1, w_6 = 0.05
```

### **📌 Data Normalization**
To standardize values:

```math
X'_{ij} = \frac{X_{ij} - \min(X_j)}{\max(X_j) - \min(X_j)}
```

### **📌 Missing Data Handling**
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**:
   ```math
   X^{(impute)}_{ij} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{n \in N(i)} X_{nj}
   ```
2. **Regression-Based Predictions**:
   ```math
   X_{ij} = \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{M} \beta_k X_{ik} + \epsilon_i
   ```

### **📌 Top 5 Medical Tourism Destinations**
| Country      | Medical Score | Hospital Beds | Healthcare Spending (USD) |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Thailand    | 0.92         | 2.1           | 850                       |
| India       | 0.89         | 1.5           | 600                       |
| Turkey      | 0.85         | 2.8           | 1200                      |
| Mexico      | 0.83         | 1.7           | 900                       |
| South Korea | 0.81         | 12.3          | 4500                      |

### **📌 Weighted Score Formula**
```math
S_i = w_1 B_i + w_2 I_i + w_3 S_i + w_4 A_i + w_5 L_i
```

Where:
- \( B_i \) = Ease of Doing Business Score
- \( I_i \) = GDP per Capita
- \( S_i \) = Safety Index
- \( A_i \) = International Air Passengers
- \( L_i \) = Annual Tourist Arrivals

**Weights:**
```math
w_1 = 0.3, w_2 = 0.3, w_3 = 0.2, w_4 = 0.1, w_5 = 0.1
```

### **📌 Top 5 MICE Destinations**
